	Abstract = {We aim to address the question of whether or not there is a significant recent `hiatus', `pause' or `slowdown' of global temperature rise. Using a statistical technique known as change point (CP) analysis we identify the changes in four global temperature records and estimate the rates of temperature rise before and after these changes occur. For each record the results indicate that three CPs are enough to accurately capture the variability in the data with no evidence of any detectable change in the global warming trend since âˆ¼1970. We conclude that the term `hiatus' or `pause' cannot be statistically justified.},

@article{bath22707,
	Abstract = {Recent work by Reiss and Ogden provides a theoretical basis for sometimes preferring restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to generalized cross-validation (GCV) for smoothing parameter selection in semiparametric regression. However, existing REML or marginal likelihood (ML) based methods for semiparametric generalized linear models (GLMs) use iterative REML or ML estimation of the smoothing parameters of working linear approximations to the GLM. Such indirect schemes need not converge and fail to do so in a non-negligible proportion of practical analyses. By contrast, very reliable prediction error criteria smoothing parameter selection methods are available, based on direct optimization of GCV, or related criteria, for the GLM itself. Since such methods directly optimize properly defined functions of the smoothing parameters, they have much more reliable convergence properties. The paper develops the first such method for REML or ML estimation of smoothing parameters. A Laplace approximation is used to obtain an approximate REML or ML for any GLM, which is suitable for efficient direct optimization. This REML or ML criterion requires that Newton-Raphson iteration, rather than Fisher scoring, be used for GLM fitting, and a computationally stable approach to this is proposed. The REML or ML criterion itself is optimized by a Newton method, with the derivatives required obtained by a mixture of implicit differentiation and direct methods. The method will cope with numerical rank deficiency in the fitted model and in fact provides a slight improvement in numerical robustness on the earlier method of Wood for prediction error criteria based smoothness selection. Simulation results suggest that the new REML and ML methods offer some improvement in mean-square error performance relative to GCV or Akaike's information criterion in most cases, without the small number of severe undersmoothing failures to which Akaike's information criterion and GCV are prone. This is achieved at the same computational cost as GCV or Akaike's information criterion. The new approach also eliminates the convergence failures of previous REML- or ML-based approaches for penalized GLMs and usually has lower computational cost than these alternatives. Example applications are presented in adaptive smoothing, scalar on function regression and generalized additive model selection.},

@article{bath32382,
	Abstract = {The problem of testing smooth components of an extended generalized additive model for equality to zero is considered. Confidence intervals for such components exhibit good across-the-function coverage probabilities if based on the approximate result {$\backslash$}hat f(i) {\texttt{\char126}} N\{f(i),V\_f(i,i)\}, where f is the vector of evaluated values for the smooth component of interest and V\_f is the covariance matrix for f according to the Bayesian view of the smoothing process. Based on this result, a Wald-type test of f=0 is proposed. It is shown that care must be taken in selecting the rank used in the test statistic. The method complements previous work by extending applicability beyond the Gaussian case, while considering tests of zero effect rather than testing the parametric hypothesis given by the null space of the component?s smoothing penalty. The proposed p-values are routine and efficient to compute from a fitted model, without requiring extra model fits or null distribution simulation.},
